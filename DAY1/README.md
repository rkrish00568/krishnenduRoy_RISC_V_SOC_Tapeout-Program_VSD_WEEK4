# Day 1: Basics of NMOS Drain Current (Id) vs Drain-to-source Voltage (Vds)

## Part 1: Introduction to Circuit Design and SPICE simulations
### The importance of W/L ratio
 - The W/L ratio determines a MOSFET’s strength — a higher W/L increases the drain current (Id), making the transistor faster. Since delay is inversely proportional to Id, a larger W/L ratio reduces propagation delay, improving circuit speed.
